File description:

Data:
HSC_LNC.xlsx is the gene expression data obtained by pretreatment of lncRNA re-annotated with gse47927. 
HSC_mRNA.xlsx is the gene expression data obtained by pretreatment of mRNA re-annotated with gse47927.
lncRNA-miRNA.xlsx is the experimentally validated miRNA-lncRNA interactions which is extracted from starBase v2.0.
mRNA-miRNA.xlsx and mRNA-miRNA2.xlsx are the experimentally validated miRNA-mRNA interaction relationships which are 
downloaded from TarBase (version 8.0) and starBase v2.0 databases. 

GSE47927SDE.R: Screening for differential genes.
DLCN.m is to identify DLCN_CP, DLCN_AP and DLCN_BC.
DNB_modules.m is to identify lncRNA-mRNA ceRNA modules in CML CP, AP and BC based on DNB.
